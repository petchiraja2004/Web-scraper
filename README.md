Hi!

Before deploy the project, create a new directory named as "templates" and put the index.html and style.css file inside the directory so that the project gives exact output. Then go to the command prompt change the directory where you put the project like "c:" and again change the directory using "cd foldername" and run the python file using command "python app.py" and then url will be generated. copy the url and enter it on chrome browser that will help to direct the web scraper application.

Thank you!
